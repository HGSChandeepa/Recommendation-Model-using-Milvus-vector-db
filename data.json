Undersea telecommunications cables are key to global economic growth and resilience. Continued growth in bandwidth demand is likely to drive further cable construction globally and in the Indo-Pacific. However, undersea cables are vulnerable to a variety of risks which can result in serious economic and security consequences. It is crucial that the Indo?Pacific region develops and manages an undersea cable network that is resilient to challenges and supports future economic growth. The Australian Government has established the Centre in DFAT to address the most important issues facing the development and management of undersea cables in the Indo-Pacific. Australia can play a more active role in supporting partner governments’ policy and regulatory development and reforms, shaping regional and global norms, as well as strengthening engagement between the public and private sector on new cable projects. To be effective, the Centre will need to work with a wide range of partners in Indo-Pacific governments, the private sector, regional and multilateral organisations, academia and think tanks, and across the Australian Government. The Centre will contribute to the Quad Partnership for Cable Connectivity and Resilience announced in 2023. The Centre aims to position Australia as a trusted partner for countries in the Indo-Pacific (South and Southeast Asia and the Pacific). DFAT’s early outreach has identified a clear need for assistance regarding undersea cable issues, particularly in Southeast Asia. The Centre will build on and work with existing Australian Government mechanisms for infrastructure funding and advice, including the Australian Infrastructure Financing Facility for the Pacific and the Partnerships for Infrastructure (P4I) program in Southeast Asia. The Centre will be flexible on how and when it works with partners and when it will work independently. ",

APEC has advanced structural reform in the region incrementally over many years by sharing economies' experiences, identifying good practices and providing capacity building. APEC brings officials, business, regulatory experts and academics together to discuss relevant issues. Two of the main avenues to promote services rform in APEC are the Group on Services (GOS), which repots to the Committee on Trade and Investment (CTI), and the Economic Committee (EC). In recent years, APEC Ministers have called for a stepping up of work on structural reform in services sectors. This project seeks to respond to that call by adding value to the work already under wya. It operates under the auspices of the EC and the GOS. The project aims to deliver three  outcomes by its completion in July 2026: 1. Unilateral, market opening economic and regulatory reforms in services sectors are increasinly prioritised by APEC economies (Reform) 2. Trade in services are increasinly on the agenda of the EC and other relevant APEC forums, including by linking the structural reform (EAASR) and services competitiveness (ASCR) agendas (Collaboration) 3. APEC developing economies have strengthened capacity to implement reform, through increased knowledge of what works, what doesn't, and what might be possible (Capacity).",

The assessment will take into consideration existing legislation, policy and process around QPS industrial measures, Enterprise Bargaining Agreements (EBA) and fatigue management practices and guidelines.  It is expected that a final deliverable will provide a set of alternate roster and work hour arrangements considering the operational requirements (rostering to community demand), employee preferences, strategic considerations, flexibility to adapt to disruption. The specific organisational scope of this engagement will be for two (of the organisational wide 15) districts.  These two districts will be used as ‘trial sites’ for improving QPS rostering capability and using the findings and lessons to inform and plan repeatable implementation in the remaining QPS districts.  For detailed information on the specific goods / services sought under this tender, please review the \"Specification \" in \"Attachment A within this RFQ\".",

Developed in consultation with over 30 agencies (including government trading enterprises), the ASDT will provide the digital capability to share, discover and visualise the State?s data, with advanced capabilities for analytics, predictive modelling, and digital workflows. Landgate will lead Program delivery and work closely with partner agencies. The initial five years of the program (Horizon One) focuses on implementation NGSC and SDT demonstrating the outcomes required through four priority use cases along with data modernisation.
